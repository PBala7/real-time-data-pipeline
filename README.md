# real-time-data-pipeline
Real time data pipeline using kafka,python,and Bigquery
Real-Time Data Pipeline Project
📘 Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline built using Apache Kafka, Python, and Google BigQuery.
The pipeline streams simulated user activity data (like logins, clicks, and logouts) from a producer to BigQuery for real-time analytics.

🏗️ Architecture
User Activity (Producer) → Kafka Topic → Consumer (Python) → BigQuery Table

Technologies Used
Linux – Environment setup and command-line operations,
Apache Kafka – Real-time data streaming platform,
Zookeeper – Manages Kafka cluster coordination,
Python – For producer and consumer scripts,
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – For hosting BigQuery,
BigQuery – For storing and querying streamed data,
Service Accounts (IAM) – For secure authentication

Skills Demonstrated
Kafka · Python · BigQuery · SQL · Linux · Real-Time Data Processing · GCP · Data Engineering
